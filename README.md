# Sudokle
A combination of sudoku and wordle

How to play:
  
  When entering guesses, press the number keys (no 0) to input your guesses row by row
    - Use backspace to delete/go back in guesses
    - Press enter to submit a row
    - Guesses do not need to fit the rules of sudoku (Maybe be updated later)
  
  For each number, one of 3 colors will appear on the space for that number
    - Green: Correct location
    - Orange: Correct grid and row but wrong location
    - Gray: Neither applies

  After you guessed all 9 rows, solving can begin
    - Click on any space and input a number to solve
    - Inputted solves will be marked blue if right and red if wrong
    - Clicking the gray button to toggle whether or not to show "clues" (the guesses made originally and colors)
